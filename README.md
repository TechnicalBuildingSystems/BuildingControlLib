BuildingControlLib
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TechnicalBuildingSystems/BuildingControlLib.svg?branch=continuousIntegration)](https://travis-ci.org/TechnicalBuildingSystems/BuildingControlLib)

Welcome to BuildingControlLib, a Modelica library for modelling and simulation of standardized and non-standardized control functions from Building Automation Systems. The library is developed and maintained at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics IBP](https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/en.html) in the [Technical Building Systems Working Group](https://www.ibp.fraunhofer.de/en/Expertise/energy-efficiency-and-indoor-climate/TechnicalBuildingSystemsSolutions.html) in Nuremberg, Germany.


### License

The model library **BuildingControlLib** is released by Fraunhofer Institute for Building Physics IBP under the [Modelica License 2.0](https://www.modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2).

### Dependencies

The libary uses models from the [**AixLib**-library](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib), version 0.4.0 and models of the [Buildings-library](https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings), version 4.0.0.

The library has been tested with Dymola 2017 FD01 64bit on Windows 7 64bit.

### Version

The current version 0.1.0 is a pre-release.
